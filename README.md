# Minecraft-RPC
A simple Implementation of Rich Presence for Minecraft Forge.

To work with this code, you must download an appropriate Forge MDK (1.12) and [setup a workspace](https://shadowfacts.net/tutorials/forge-modding-112/workspace-setup/), then clone this repo into the workspace.
To build a usable jar, use `gradle shadowJar` (with `./gradlew` or `gradle.bat` respectively).

This Mod uses the Java-DiscordRPC lib by @MinnDevelopment.

Downloads are availabe [on Curseforge](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/minecraft-rpc).
